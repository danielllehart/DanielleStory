One warm day sarah convinced her parents to walk the oceanfront boardwalk. She told them she wanted to see the dolphins but secretly ho
ped they would stop for icecream. Sarah was a chocolate fanatic and Ben and Jerry's had just released their newest chocolate flavor. She had been hoping to indulge herself in that awesome new chocolate ice cream for a few weeks now, today she decided it would be the day it would become a reality. Although Sarah's parents took a little convincing before they would get her ice cream, she finally had the delicious ice cream in her hand. Watching the dolphins swim through the sunset while eating her favorite ice cream made it one of Sarah's greatest days. But what could a better day than this, pizza! Sarah picked up her iPhone, and dialed the number for Dominoes. She told them all her favorite toppings. While she waited, she watched the dolphins swim. As the sun set and the steet lights turned on, the pizza arrived: making this day much better.
